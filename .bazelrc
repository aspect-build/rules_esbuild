# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# .bazelrc.user should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with team members
# This needs to be last statement in this

# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc

# rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)
